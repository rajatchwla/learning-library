# OCI Language

## Introduction

Language is serverless and multi-tenant service that is accessible using REST API calls. It provides pretrained models that are frequently retrained and monitored to provide you with the best results.

You can automate sophisticated text analysis at scale without any machine learning expertise.

The Language service contains these pretrained language processing capabilities:

### 1. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis
Identifies aspects from the given text and classifies each into positive, negative, or neutral polarity.

### 2. Named Entity Recognition
Identifies common entities, people, places, locations, email, and so on.

### 3. Key Phrase Extraction
Extracts an important set of phrases from a block of text.

### 4. Language Detection
Detects languages based on the given text, and includes a confidence score.

### 5. Text Classification
Identifies the document category and subcategory that the text belongs to.

Explore the Language service within the Oracle Cloud AI service group to perform NLP tasks like detecting languages, extracting key elements, classifying intent, detecting the sentiment, etc., in the text with a few simple steps.

*Estimated Lab Time*: 40 minutes

### Objectives:

* Understand a high level overview of the OCI Language Service
* Understand the full cycle/workflow of services provided in the OCI Language
* Learn to use REST API to interact with OCI Language service
* Learn to use CLI to interact with AI Language service
* Learn to access OCI Language Service in DataScience NotebookSession
* Learn to access OCI Language Service in Data Flow.

### Prerequisites:
* An Oracle Free Tier, or Paid Cloud Account
* Additional prerequisites (cloud services) are mentioned per lab
* Familiar with OCI Policy and SDK/CLI setup.
* Familiar with Python/Java programming for SDK usage is strongly recommended.
* Familiar with OCI  services like DataScience, DataFlow etc., are recommended, but not required.
* Familiar with editing tools (vim, nano) or shell environments (cmd, bash, etc) (Optional for API integration)
